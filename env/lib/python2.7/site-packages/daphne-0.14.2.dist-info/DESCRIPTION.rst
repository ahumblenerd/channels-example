Daphne is a HTTP, HTTP2 and WebSocket protocol server for
`ASGI <http://channels.readthedocs.org/en/latest/asgi.html>`_, and developed
to power Django Channels.

It supports automatic negotiation of protocols; there's no need for URL
prefixing to determine WebSocket endpoints versus HTTP endpoints.


Running
-------

Simply point Daphne to your ASGI channel layer instance, and optionally
set a bind address and port (defaults to localhost, port 8000)::

    daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8001 django_project.asgi:channel_layer


Root Path (SCRIPT_NAME)
-----------------------

In order to set the root path for Daphne, which is the equivalent of the
WSGI ``SCRIPT_NAME`` setting, you have two options:

* Pass a header value ``Daphne-Root-Path``, with the desired root path as a
  URLencoded ASCII value. This header will not be passed down to applications.

* Set the ``--root-path`` commandline option with the desired root path as a
  URLencoded ASCII value.

The header takes precedence if both are set. As with ``SCRIPT_ALIAS``, the value
should start with a slash, but not end with one; for example::

    daphne --root-path=/forum django_project.asgi:channel_layer
